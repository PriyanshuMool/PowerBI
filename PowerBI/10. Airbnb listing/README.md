Since github does not allow to upload files of size more than 25 MB, I'll be sharing a link in the README file to the entire project.
Which includes the dataframe, and the Power BI dashboard.
1. I got this open dataframe/dataset from: https://public.opendatasoft.com/explore/dataset/air-bnb-listings/export/?disjunctive.neighbourhood&disjunctive.column_10&disjunctive.city
2. Link to my project: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/15s7Ez8djZk0TuKXY5gxdYZx6mvk94pjf?usp=sharing
3. This link also includes the data analysis I performed on the raw dataset using python, cleaning the data, and doing some analysis with python. I will also upload the python file here as well.
